# CFD-Airfoil Mesh Preprocessor
The code comprises of a general preprocessor for generating an O-type mesh grid around a NACA airfoil, The resultant finite volume mesh can be used to solve for complex flow conditions using Navier stokes and potential field theories. The steps can be described as follows, a NACA 4 digit airfoil is first created using the already established equations. A simple computational domain is created with Nxi and Neta points along the boundaries such that it creates a simple rectangle. After this, the mapping from the complex physical domain (comprising of the airfoil and surrounding air O-type) to the simple computational domain is performed via interpolations techniques (Algebraic/transfinite interpolation method), thus creating the initial mesh. The easiest way is to map the boundaries between the domains and interpolate the interior points based on the assigned boundary limits.

This generated algebraic mesh is uniform and smooth at the boundaries and away from the airfoil. However, the grid generated near the airfoil and its edges are not continuous or smooth due to the linear nature of the interpolation technique. To make this mesh smoother at the interior regions, an elliptical partial differential equation is solved with the algebraic mesh being used as the inital conditions.These elliptical PDEs are then solved using iterative methods (Gauss-Siedel)
